=============
TDD templates
=============

a collection of ready-to-use code skeletons, each setup for a specific combination of programming language and unit testing framework


What it does
============

These TDD templates give you everything you need in order to start a small test driven project. They are sorted according to the programming language and unit testing framework they use.

Everything is setup so you can immediately start coding: all necessary files exist and common build automation tools allow you to compile and run your application tests.

The current focus lies on unit tests but integration tests might follow in the future.

Typical use cases
-----------------

* *You are new to unit testing and want to get your feet wet?*

  These templates allow you to start coding immediately.
  They also provide you with a good opportunity to compare different unit test frameworks.

* *You just want a bare bone TDD project so you can play around with unit tests?*

  Select a programming language along with a unit testing framework and start coding.

Key features
------------

* *Start coding right away.* Everything is in place; no further setup is needed.
* *Build targets* allow you to easily compile and run your tests or application.


Getting started
===============

Each template contains a README describing how to perform a typical TDD cycle with it.
Have a look at the `C_CppUTest`_ template for an example.
You can also switch to the `TDD examples`_ repository to see these templates in action with actual application and test code.


Contributing
============

This collection still lacks many common programming languages and unit test frameworks. Have a look at the `open issues`_ for additional ideas on how to contribute. Furthermore, if you have a neat idea for a new feature or some other improvement, I am looking forward to recieving a pull request from you:

1. `Fork it`_
2. Create your feature branch: ``$ git checkout -b my-new-feature``
3. Commit all your changes: ``$ git commit -am 'add some feature'``
4. Push to your feature branch: ``$ git push origin my-new-feature``
5. Submit a `pull request`_

Please follow the `contribution guidelines`_ prior to making a pull request.
