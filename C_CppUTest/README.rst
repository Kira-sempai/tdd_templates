===============
C with CppUTest
===============

=====================  ============
Programming language:  **C**
Testing framework:     **CppUTest**
Build automation:      **Make**
=====================  ============


Structure
=========

Source files
------------

* ``src/main.c``: the main application's entry point
* ``src/module.*``: the main application's functions that shall be tested
* ``test/UnitTests.cc``: unit tests; runs as a separate test application

Makefile targets
----------------

* ``all``: compile everything, i.e application and tests (default target)
* ``clean``: remove all files generated by make
* ``main``: compile and run main application
* ``test``: compile and run test application

Usage: ``$ make <target>``, e.g. ``$ make all`` or just ``$ make`` since it is the default target


Toolchain
=========
This will install all necessary tools::

    $ sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make cpputest


CppUTest
========

Manual
------

Have a look at the `CppUTest manual <https://cpputest.github.io/manual.html>`_ for information on commonly used assertions, command line switches, additional memory leak detection, mocks, and more.

Scripts
-------

In addition to cloning this repository, it is possible to call scripts located in ``/usr/share/cpputest/scripts/`` to create initial header, source, and Test files. You can find out where on your system *CppUTest* is installed by using ``whereis``::

    $ whereis cpputest
    cpputest: /usr/share/cpputest
